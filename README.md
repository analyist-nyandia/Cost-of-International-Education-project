## 🚀 Analysis Workflow

**1. Data Loading & Inspection**  
- Read dataset files using Pandas  
- Inspected structure, columns, and data types  

**2. Data Pre-processing**  
- Cleaned missing or inconsistent data  
- Converted fields to appropriate data types (e.g., numeric, datetime)  
- Created derived columns such as Total Cost estimates  

**3. Statistical Methods & Pattern Discovery**  
- Summary statistics: Mean, Median, Distribution Analysis  
- Grouped comparisons by country, city, degree level  
- Profitability-like analysis for affordable vs expensive locations  

**4. Data Visualization**  
- Bar charts, line plots, and distribution plots for key variables  
- Visual comparisons of tuition, rent, and living costs  
- Geographic insights on most and least affordable study destinations  

**5. Hypothesis Testing**  
- Hypothesis example: "Living costs significantly vary across continents"  
- Statistical tests applied to support or reject hypotheses  

**6. Results Interpretation**  
- Summarized trends, affordability patterns, and regional differences  
- Offered insights for prospective students and policy makers
